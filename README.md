# Critical Path Program
This program allows the user to enter a series of activities/related dependencies and will efficiently map and calculate the 'Critical Path' of the project (i.e the sequence of activities that allow the project to be completed quickest). Developed using Python, but I hope to expand this program by adding graph visualizaton capabilities/animation using matplotlib and other related libraries. 

## Inspiration
I was inspired to pursue this project during one of my business courses in which we learned about the 'Critical Path Method' for project management. As soon as I read the words 'graph' and 'network flow', the CS part of my brain turned on and I thought 'hey, this looks like something I can do'
