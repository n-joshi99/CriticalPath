# Critical Path Method (CPM) Calculator
### Created by: Nikhill Joshi
### Last update: 5/9/2021


## Description
This program allows the user to enter a series of activities/related dependencies and will efficiently map and calculate the 'Critical Path' of the project (i.e the sequence of activities that allow the project to be completed in the shortest amount of time). Developed using Python, but I hope to expand this program by adding graph visualizaton capabilities/animation using matplotlib.


## Inspiration
I was inspired to pursue this project during one of my business courses in which we learned about the 'Critical Path Method' for Project Management. As soon as I read the words 'graph' and 'network flow', the technical part of my brain turned on and I thought 'hey, this looks like something I can do'. And so I did! This project also served a dual purpose to get me familiar with GitHub and the iterative process of versional control, updating code, and writing proper documentation. 


## Current status
Project is currently on-hold due to academic and work constraints, but I hope to continue working on this project and further expand its capabilities in efficiency, UI, and functionality.
